## Things To do for Part 2:
### This is not coding
- Write a Level II UML Use Case Diagram based on part B (4 Use Cases, 2 Actors, 2 Extends, 3 Includes.)
- Write 2 Use case scenarios based on part B
- Write a refractored UML Class Diagram to structure your code using the classes, requirements, and concepts described in PART B
### This is Coding
- Refractor you Existing Code 
  - fix anything that should be corrected
- Handle receiving an input file that does not have the information listed instandard column orders as previous assignment. (For instance, Identification Number is not column 1, First Name is not column 2, etc).
- Create and use and interface in your system.
  - the system should be used in at least 2 different classes.
  - it may be necessary to refractor your code
  - Consider using a design patter to meet this requirement.
- Use a design patter as part of your refractoring process.
  - select one of the design patterns discussed in class or use one that you have researched on your own.
  - discuss its use in the lab report.
-   add new user functionality
